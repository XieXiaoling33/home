					I also have an interest in music. I started playing the piano when I was young, but after a few years, I decided to try out a 
					Chinese instrument called the guzheng. It’s a very cool instrument, and I liked it instantly. Click 
					<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guzheng">here</a> to learn more about the guzheng, I’m sure you’ll be fascinated as well!
